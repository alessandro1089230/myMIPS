# myMIPS

Project to understand how processors are built.  
Based on MIPS instruction set.

## GOAL ðŸ‘ŸðŸ’¨âš½

[] run on FPGA  
[] integrate in a system with IO, display, sound, ...  

## PLATFORM
source: Verilog & SystemVerilog
### BUILD1
compilation: `iverilog`  
linker + simulation: `iverilog`  
inspection: `gtkwave`  

### BUILD 2
